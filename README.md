+ Makes YouTube homepage less bloated and more pure experience.
+ Makes YouTube a safer, non-bloated, non-fanatic, place to just watch videos.

(Assuming you have uBlock Origin installed. If not, install it. Or if you use ABP, you can install it manually, but some features might not work)

### Why do i make this?
Because i REALLY hate what YouTube does recently (on year 2021).
YouTube now is heavy, full with bloated, network-chugging, and now mostly tiktok-related features and videos (H3LL, now YouTube tries to wreck useful thing on the platform by removing public dislike count, which this filter list can't even restore)


While there's "uBlock Annonyances", "Fanboy Annonyances", "Anti-cancer", and others that blocks some "annonying features/alert" on youtube,

This script reduces trash contents (video, channel, already watched video), and useless features (recently youtube added clip feature, and changing video title font from Roboto Regular to YTSans Bold),

Making YouTube more clean, faster to load & navigate around, and less trashy & bloated.

#### Note
- (for Phone users) You need to use browser that supports extension (specifically uBlock Origin, eg. Firefox).
- This filter may not work if you use ABP because this filter was designed specifically for uBO.
- This list primarily supports desktop version. mobile version also supported, but not really much.
- Content blocker specialized for indo peoples, may block videos/channels you probably don't want.
