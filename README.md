# Why i make this?
Because i REALLY Hate what YouTube does recently (on year 2021).
YouTube now is heavy, full with bloated, network-chugging, and now mostly tiktok-related features and videos
While there's "uBlock Annonyances", "Fanboy Annonyances", "Anti-cancer", and others that blocks some "annonying features/alert",
This script reduces Trash Contents (video, channel, already watched video), and useless features (recently youtube added clip feature, and changing video title font from Roboto Regular to YTSans Bold),
Making YouTube more clean, faster to load & navigate around, and less trashy & bloated.
