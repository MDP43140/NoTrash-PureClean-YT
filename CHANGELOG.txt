===============================

 Bugs:
 - Block Bypassed: [KanakKanak,waiting upon fix...]
 -                 [MobileLegends, mobile gen (w/o "le")]
 -                 [RockNRoll, rock ... rol(is true instead), rock(false),]
 -                 [Kpop, kpop(itself lmao :)]
 - Block [Chinese,Korea,Japan,Russia] languages. [\u3040-\u30FF\u4E00-\u9FFF\u3400-\u4DBF\uF900-\uFAFF\uFF66-\uFF9F\u3131-\uD79D\uAC00-\uD7AF\u1100-\u11FF\u3130-\u318F\uA960-\uA97F\uD7B0-\uD7FF\u0000-\u0019\u0400-\u04FF]. but it blocks everything (in search page).
 WARNING:
 - Use the . operator carefully since often class/negated character class are faster & more precise.
 - if you use (a|b?), that possibly wont work. instead you have to do the hack: ((a|b)?)
 - /ANYTHING/gui | THE G IS INSTEAD CAUSING THE BLOCKER TO STOP WORK. DONT EVER INSERT G
